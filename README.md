main.py has the code for face tracking we need to merge the face mask detection algo link :<https://colab.research.google.com/github/deepme987/Tensorflow-Object-Detection/blob/master/Object_Detection_Face_Mask_Detection.ipynb>  
for detecting facial patterns of terrorists for example: the momins wearing caps (training the model is necessary for this// using own database)
OpenPose is unnecessary
